# Overview

Passworder is a small web-app for users to create strong, algorithmic passwords. Simply input your basic preferences, and drag and drop to finalize your algorithmic password.

## Under The Hood

A single-page layout that uses SolidJS primitives such as Context, refs, signals, and effects. All designs and stylings were hand-made.

## Looking Forward
- [ ] Make a logo mainly for the favicon
- [ ] input restrictions on each input field
- [ ] add in more context for the certain limitations on the password components.
- [ ] maybe a table for showing how the password changes for each website. 
- [ ] localStorage?
- [ ] create Footer and some basic information
- [ ] give options to email or download the finalized password
